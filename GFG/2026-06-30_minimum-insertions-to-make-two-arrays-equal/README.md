## Description

Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, find the minimum number of insertions and deletions on the array a[], required to make both the arrays identical.

Note: Array b[] is sorted and all its elements are distinct, operations can be performed at any index not necessarily at the end.

Examples :

Input: a[] = [1, 2, 5, 3, 1], b[] = [1, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Delete 2 from a: a[] = [1, 5, 3, 1]
Insert 3 after 1: a[] = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]
Delete the last two elements: a[] = [1, 3, 5]
Total operations = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Input: a[] = [1, 4], b[] = [1, 4]
Output : 0
Explanation: Both the Arrays are already identical.


 Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 105
